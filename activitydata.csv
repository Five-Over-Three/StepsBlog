2025,6,2,13906,11888,0,0,0,0,"I have the 13yr old for homework, dinner & video games on Monday evenings so multiple trips ferrying him to and from the ex‘s house made hitting today’s target easy"
2025,6,3,12022,9930,0,0,0,0,Thought I was smart going for a Big Walk early in the day. I was not. Got absolutely drenched by the rain and only managed 9.5k steps before going home for a hot bath.

2025,6,20,17083,14577,0,0,0,0,Walked all the way down to Teddington Lock this morning. Saw a Goose Gang and a pretty bridge. Now I am very tired and falling asleep on the sofa

2025,6,22,12179,10521,0,0,0,0,I think my ear holes have grown. I’ve had to move up to the next biggest tip thingies for my ear buds. Actual steps are more - spent the day chasing the dog around the garden. Bonus pic: Smelly Dog and the Forbidden Popcorn

2025,6,24,10878,9927,0,0,0,0,Turns out doing a fast late night walk yesterday and then having a coffee at 11.30pm is not a smart idea. Soooo tired today… Having an early(ish) night tonight and hopefully will be fully human tomorrow.
2025,6,25,11940,10876,0,0,0,0,Succeeded only in being roughly 38% human today. Sluggish & headachy. Still managed a decent walk & felt a little better after.

2025,6,28,10307,7290,0,0,0,0,At Thorpe Park for most of the day - easy win for steps. I’m in a battle of Postcards with someone in Japan in Pikmin Bloom. They’re sending lovely pics of shrines etc whereas 95% of my gallery is just red post boxes…

2025,8,25,10141,9400,0,0,0,85.4,Trying to get back into walking and working - I'm going to be streaming co-working as much as possible as it is apparent that I cannot get very much done without someone over my shoulder poking me. I'm also going to try and get some strength training done on a daily basis. I will need to find a good way to document all this on my blog.
2025,8,26,12280,10700,40,40,40,84.0,"Not a good day on the work front - my routine was disrupted by an unexpected visitor and I found it impossible to get back on track after that. It seems that if I get started, I can continue, but if anything gets in the way and breaks the flow, then I find it very hard to get back into the routine. I will have to think about ways to counteract this.

On the other hand, I did make decent progress on steps - I went out first thing in the morning before breakfast and got most of the steps done. I found this set me up well for the rest of the day, so where possible, I'm going to try and stick to this."
