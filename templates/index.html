    <h1>Activity Blog</h1>
    <div id="comment_text">
        <p>At the start of June 2025, I challenged myself to walk 10,000 steps a day for the entire month. I posted the distance and number of steps to Twitter every day in an effort to keep myself honest.</p><br />
        <p>I succeeded and found out a couple of interesting things about myself:</p><br />
        <ul>
            <li>The exercise was very beneficial for my physical and mental health and for managing my ADHD</li>
            <li>By posting to Twitter, I was making myself accountable which was incredibly effective in not just letting things slide</li>
        </ul><br />
        <p>In addition, I was losing weight very quickly, which is a good thing as I was a bit of a blob.</p><br />
        <p>Rather than relentlessly boring my friends on Twitter, I decided to start this blog, both as a way to carry on the above benefits, but also to force myself to learn new things. From a very rudimentary knowledge of basic HTML, I am now self-hosting this site on a Raspberry Pi in my living room and have built this site using Python, Flask, nginx and gunicorn!</p><br />

        <h3>November Challenge</h3><br />
        <p>My aim is to do 10,000 steps, 100 push-ups and 100 sit-ups every day in November. Daily progress is shown in the calendar below. Click a day to see how I'm doing!</p><br />
